# Node Application Deployment on Kubernetes

## Overview

The Nautilus Development and DevOps teams collaborated to deploy a Node.js application on a Kubernetes cluster. 
This deployment ensures scalability, reliability, and accessibility through a NodePort service.
This document describes the steps, configurations, and verification process used to successfully deploy and expose the application.

## Objective
The goal of this task was to:
 - Deploy a Node.js application containerized using the image gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node.
 - Ensure 2 replicas of the application are always running.
 - Expose the deployment externally using a NodePort Service with specific port configurations.

## Kubernetes Deployment Details
1. Deployment Configuration
A Kubernetes Deployment named node-app was created with the following specifications:
 - Image: gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node
 - Replicas: 2
 - Container Port: 8080
 - Label Selector: app: node-app

Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-app
  labels:
    app: node-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: node-app
          image: gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```
This deployment ensures that if any pod fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it to maintain two running replicas.

2. Service Configuration
A NodePort Service named node-app-service was created to expose the application outside the cluster.
 - Service Type: NodePort
 - Port: 8080
 - Target Port: 8080
 - Node Port: 30012
 - Selector: app: node-app

Service YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: node-app-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: node-app
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30012
```
This configuration allows users to access the application using the Kubernetes nodeâ€™s IP and port 30012.

Verification Steps
Once both YAML files were applied, the following commands were used to verify the deployment:

Check running pods
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Expected output: 2 pods in Running state.

Check service status
```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Expected output:
```yaml
node-app-service   NodePort   ...   8080:30012/TCP
```
Access the application
You can access the running Node.js application via:
```cpp
http://<Node-IP>:30012
```

## Summary
 - Deployment: Node.js app using gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node
 - Replicas: 2 running pods
 - Service Type: NodePort (Port 8080 â†’ NodePort 30012)
 - Verification: Successful â€” pods running and app accessible via NodePort
