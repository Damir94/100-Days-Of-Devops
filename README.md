# 🚀 100 Days of DevOps – Real Projects, Real Learning

I’ve started my 100 Days of DevOps challenge to strengthen my skills through consistent, hands-on practice. This journey is focused on real-world projects that simulate the problems DevOps engineers face in production environments:

 - ✅ Application Deployment (Project Nautilus)
 - ☸️ Kubernetes Orchestration
 - 🔧 Terraform Automation
---

## 🧩 Projects Overview

### 1. ⚓ Project Nautilus – xFusionCorp Industries
> Simulating a real company DevOps role

**Project Nautilus** is the Naval subdivision of xFusionCorp Industries. It’s a mission-critical web application built to help naval forces make smarter procurement decisions for manned and unmanned maritime systems, while ensuring operational requirements, safety, and long-term cost-efficiency.

#### 🏗 Architecture:
- **Three-tier deployment** in a North American datacenter
  - **Client Tier**: Web browser interface
  - **Application Tier**: LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP)
  - **Data Tier**: MariaDB for RDBMS
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx HTTP load balancer
- **Shared Services**:
  - NAS-based external storage
  - Secure SFTP for file transfer
  - Backup staging server
  - Jump server (SSH gateway for access control)

#### 🎯 DevOps Scope:
- Provisioning secure access (jump servers, SSH key management)
- Deploying and configuring a 3-tier application
- Setting up load balancing with Nginx
- Automating backups and storage
- Documenting every step with screenshots, CLI commands, and best practices

---

### 2. ☸ Kubernetes Hands-On Path

A deep-dive into Kubernetes through daily tasks covering:
- Pod, Service, and Deployment management
- ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Volumes
- Rolling updates and rollback strategies
- Helm chart creation and usage
- Troubleshooting and debugging

---

### 3. 🛠 Terraform Infrastructure Automation

Using Terraform to provision infrastructure in a cloud-agnostic, repeatable way. Tasks include:
- Writing modules for reusable infrastructure components
- Managing state files securely
- Integrating with providers like AWS, GCP
- Infrastructure testing and validation

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

Each day contains subfolders for the three projects.
Inside each, you’ll find:
- `README.md` – description, steps, learnings
- `/code` – actual scripts, manifests, configs
- `/screenshots` – visual proof and context

---

## 🎯 My goals with this challenge:

 - Build a portfolio that demonstrates real business impact

 - Gain deeper expertise in Linux, CI/CD, cloud provisioning, monitoring & troubleshooting

 - Practice structuring and documenting technical work for teams, recruiters, and long-term growth

This isn’t just a tutorial exercise — it’s about solving practical deployment and operational challenges while continuously improving as a DevOps engineer.
