# Git Branch Cleanup – Removing Test Branches from Blog Repository

## Overview
During the active development phase of the Nautilus blog project, several temporary branches were created for testing purposes. 
To maintain a clean and organized Git repository, the DevOps team was assigned to remove unnecessary branches that are no longer in use.

This document explains how the xfusioncorp_blog branch was safely deleted from the local Git repository located at:
```swift
/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
```
## Environment
  - Server: Storage Server (Stratos Datacenter)
  - Repository Path: /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
  - Branch to Delete: xfusioncorp_blog

## Steps Performed
1. Navigate to the Repository Directory
First, switch to the directory where the Git repository is stored:
```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
```
2. Verify Existing Branches
List all available branches to confirm that xfusioncorp_blog exists:
```bash
git branch
```
Output example:
```css
main
develop
xfusioncorp_blog
```
3. Delete the Branch
Use the following command to delete the xfusioncorp_blog branch safely:
```bash
git branch -d xfusioncorp_blog
```
The -d flag performs a safe deletion, which means Git won’t remove the branch if it contains unmerged changes.

4. Force Delete (if required)
If Git prevents deletion due to unmerged work (and you’re sure it’s no longer needed), use the force delete option:
```bash
git branch -D xfusioncorp_blog
```
5. Verify Deletion
Recheck the branch list to ensure it has been removed:
```bash
git branch
```
Expected output:
```css
main
develop
```
## Result
  - The xfusioncorp_blog branch was successfully deleted.
  - The repository is now cleaner, reducing confusion and potential merge conflicts.
  - Development can continue with a streamlined branch structure.

## Notes
  - Always ensure branches are merged or no longer needed before deletion.
  - Use git branch -d (safe) before resorting to -D (force).
  - For remote branches, you can use:
  - git push origin --delete xfusioncorp_blog

## Summary
This cleanup task was part of ongoing repository maintenance within the Stratos DC environment. 
Regular branch cleanups help improve team efficiency, reduce repository clutter, and maintain a professional Git workflow.
